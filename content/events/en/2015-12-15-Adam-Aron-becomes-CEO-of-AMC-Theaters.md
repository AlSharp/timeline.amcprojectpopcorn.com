**“This is an incredible opportunity to lead one of the most recognized and iconic brands in the entertainment industry,** said Aron.
**“AMC Theatres is at the forefront of developing customer-focused innovations at theatres across the country, such as plush recliner chairs and new sight and sound technology. Even so, I believe we have the capacity to raise the bar even higher. In addition to further enhancing the movie-going experience at our theaters, of special interest is enriching AMC Stubs as a community for those who are fascinated by the allure of motion pictures. Having had the opportunity to lead teams elsewhere that have produced superior financial and customer results in other entertainment and hospitality industries, I am so excited now to lead the best team in the U.S. theatrical exhibition business. The opportunity to partner with other entities in the Wanda Group is also particularly intriguing. As a life-long movie fan myself, I am looking forward to winning with this team and amazing our guests.”**
