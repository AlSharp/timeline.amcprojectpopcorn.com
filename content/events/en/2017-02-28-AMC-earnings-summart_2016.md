Executives
- John C. Merriwether - AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.
- Adam M. Aron - AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.

>Adam Aron: **I believe in putting my money where my mouth is** and with so much personal confidence in where AMC is headed I personally purchased $1 million worth of AMC stock as part of the recent AMC offering. This is the third time in a year that I have bought AMC shares using personal funds. My belief in the future prospects for AMC extends all the way to my right back pants pocket where I keep my wallet.

## During the whole call the word "debt" was not mentioned once

### Adam Aron on dilution - 1 year in office

>**Our public float is up some 160%, far more than doubling to 55.7 million shares**

>As you know, as part of the financing of both the Carmike and Nordic acquisitions we recently completed a successful equity offering. We raised $640 million of equity prior to underwriter's fees by issuing approximately 20.3 million shares of Class A common stock at $31.50 per share.

### Adam Aron in regards to executive bonuses

>2016 was a busy year for AMC with respect to acquisition, and to that end, I would specifically like to go out of my way to call to your attention something noted in the CFO commentary. **2016 M&A costs include $10 million of transaction-related compensation consisting of special bonuses approved by AMC's Board of Directors paid in part to some two dozen members of the AMC management team in recognition of their successful efforts to put into place and to complete the acquisitions of Odeon and Carmike in 2016. These bonuses were wholly unsolicited by the management.** They were funded in 2017 by our largest shareholder, Dalian Wanda, and were recorded as a capital contribution in 2016. **Naturally we are grateful.**

### Adam Aron key statements in regards to dilution
>I believe in putting my money where my mouth is and with so much personal confidence in where AMC is headed I personally purchased $1 million worth of AMC stock as part of the recent AMC offering. This is the third time in a year that I have bought AMC shares using personal funds. My belief in the future prospects for AMC extends all the way to my right back pants pocket where I keep my wallet.

>**Last January AMC's public float was 21.6 million shares. The average daily trading volume in AMC stock was about 300,000 shares and our market cap was less than $2 billion. Fast forward a little over a year. Our public float is up some 160%, far more than doubling to 55.7 million shares that liquidly can trade.** Our average daily volume since the offering, excluding that huge first day of trading right after the offering is 1.5 million shares and **our market cap now exceeds $4 billion.**

>At AMC we are highly cognizant that our charge is to smartly increase long-term shareholder value. We clearly focused on that in 2016 and our focus on doing so continues in 2017 and beyond. In 2016, AMC took on the number one position in the U.S., the number one position in Europe and the number one position in our industry in the world. Our future looks bright in 2017 for AMC. And I, for one, think we're in for yet another record year.

### Craig R. Ramsey - AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.

>So on the leverage question, Eric, I think if you went back and kind of did the math after the Odeon, Carmike transactions and kind of a pro forma basis you'd have leverage at about 4.6, maybe 4.7 times, somewhere in that range. **With the proceeds from the equity offering and the pay down of that bridge and we've put some cash on the balance sheet that we'll utilize in Nordic, the leverage drops to right around four times.** So then roll forward and complete the Nordic financing and the Nordic transactions sometimes here in early 2017 and your leverage goes back up, you've already got the equity taking the leverage down to four times. **It's going to go back up to probably the 4.5, 4.6 range.**
