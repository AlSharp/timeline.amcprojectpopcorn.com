### Adam Aron, CEO and President of AMC Entertainment

> Fiscal year 2017 ended on a very positive note, much like it began, as movie-goers patronized AMC theatres in significant numbers. The acquisitions of Odeon, Carmike and Nordic, and the investments we made during 2017, both domestically and internationally, in food and beverage initiatives, in our signature recliners and in premium sight and sound experiences, together with previously announced revenue enhancements and cost controls drove record revenues and improved operating margins in the fourth quarter. 

>As we look forward to 2018 and beyond, we are pleased and greatly encouraged by the progress we made during and since the fourth quarter of 2017, both operationally and in dealing with several specific industry challenges. And naturally, we are inspired by the record breaking audiences that are coming to our movie theatres across the U.S. and Europe to take in BLACK PANTHER. With more great movies on the horizon, and further investment at AMC in guest heralded amenities, we are increasingly optimistic about the potential for success at AMC Entertainment in 2018 and the years to come.

## Dividends

On October 27, 2017, the Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, which was paid on December 18, 2017, to shareholders of record on December 4, 2017. The total dividends paid in the fourth quarter of 2017 were approximately $25.9 million.

On February 28, 2018, the Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share of for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, payable on March 26, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 12, 2018.

## Income Taxes

During the fourth quarter, the Tax Reform Act of 2017 was signed into law. Among other things, the Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018.

Income taxes for the first nine months of 2017 were recorded using an estimated effective tax rate of 39%. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we determined in accordance with accounting standards that a valuation allowance or reserve against our deferred tax assets was required. Our deferred tax assets primarily relate to deferred revenue and lease accounting items.

Based on the resulting impact of the passage of the Tax Reform Act and the valuation allowance on the Company’s deferred tax assets, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $310.0 million to the income tax provision in our U.S. markets for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.

Going forward we expect our consolidated effective tax rate to be between 22% and 26%.
