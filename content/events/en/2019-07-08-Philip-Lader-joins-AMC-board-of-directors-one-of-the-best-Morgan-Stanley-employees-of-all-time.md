![Lader Law expert](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1T4u_2PEIJQ/maxresdefault.jpg)

>After Plaintiff "Linda Lao" filed her Complaint, Defendants caused AMC’s Board to create a two-person **Special Litigation Committee ("SLC")** consisting of Adam Sussman and **Philip Lader.** The SLC then conducted a lengthy investigation with which Wanda and Wang failed to cooperate The SLC then moved to dismiss Plaintiff’s entire-fairness claims in their entirety.

### What the SLC did - Clean Up?

On July 18, 2019, the Board of Directors of **AMC formed the SLC, consisting of Ambassador Philip Lader and Adam J. Sussman**, to, among other things, 
- (i) consider and determine whether or not prosecution of the claims asserted in the Action was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and what action the Company should take with respect to the Action, and 
- (ii) determine the appropriate actions to be taken on behalf of and in the name of the Company with respect to the claims asserted in the Action, including, without limitation, whether to pursue the claims, whether to seek an extrajudicial resolution of the claims, or whether to seek one or more orders from the Court to dismiss or stay the Action.

### or - to gain time.

On September 6, 2019, the SLC moved to stay the Action pending the SLC’s investigation.

On November 15, 2019, the Court granted the SLC’s motion to stay the Action pending the SLC’s investigation.

On March 16, 2020, the SLC moved to extend the stay of the Action pending the SLC’s continued investigation, which the Court granted on March 17, 2020.

On July 6, 2020 and December 10, 2020, the SLC moved for additional stays of the Action pending the SLC’s continued investigation, which the Court granted on July 29, 2020 and December 18, 2020.

### The SLC’s investigation ultimately extended over an eighteen-month period, during which it retained a legal advisor, valuation expert, corporate governance expert, and investment banking expert to aid with its evaluation of Plaintiff’s claims, conducted twenty-one interviews, and reviewed more than 40,000 documents.

On January 8, 2021, the SLC filed the Report, in which the SLC concluded that pursuing the Action was not in the best interests of the Company and recommended that the Action be dismissed with prejudice.

**Also on January 8, 2021, the SLC filed a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint (the “Motion to Dismiss”).**

Following the SLC’s Report and Motion to Dismiss, the Parties engaged in discovery regarding the SLC’s investigation. Plaintiff served document demands and interrogatories on the SLC and Wanda. In total, Plaintiff **received and reviewed over 2,600 documents, totaling more than 28,000 pages.** (not 40.000 documents) 
**Plaintiff also deposed both members of the SLC, as well as the SLC’s investment banking expert, corporate governance expert, and valuation expert.**

On January 27, 2022, Plaintiff’s Counsel, the SLC’s Counsel, and Defendants’ Counsel participated in a full day mediation session before retired United States District Court Judge Layn R. Phillips and former Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz partner David Murphy (together, the “Mediators”). In advance of that session, the Parties exchanged opening and reply mediation statements and exhibits with one another and provided the same to the Mediators, which addressed both liability and damages. The session ended without any agreement being reached.

Following the mediation, the Parties engaged in additional negotiations under the supervision and guidance of the Mediators. As a result of extensive, arm’s-length negotiations during and after the mediation session, the Parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the Action that was memorialized in a term sheet (the “Term Sheet”), which was executed on April 27, 2022, and subsequently memorialized in the Stipulation, which was filed with the Court on June 6, 2022.

On June 24, 2022, the Court entered a Scheduling Order in connection with the Settlement, which, among other things, authorized a Notice and scheduled a Settlement Hearing to consider whether to grant final approval of the Settlement.

### On August 18, 2022, Plaintiff filed her Application for Approval of Settlement and Award of Attorneys’ Fees and Expenses.

On September 9, 2022, the SLC filed its Brief in Support of Proposed Settlement. On September 12, 2022, Plaintiff filed a letter responding to the SLC’s Brief in Support of Proposed Settlement. On September 13, 2022, the SLC filed an Amended Brief in Support of Proposed Settlement.

On September 15, 2022, the Court held a hearing to consider Plaintiff’s Application for Approval of Settlement and Award of Attorneys’ Fees and Expenses. After hearing argument from counsel for Plaintiff and the SLC, the Court ordered the Parties to issue this supplemental notice to AMC stockholders in order to provide additional detail regarding Plaintiff’s theory of liability and how to access documents filed in the Action. As set forth below, the Court has scheduled a second Settlement Hearing, which will take place on November 30, 2022.
