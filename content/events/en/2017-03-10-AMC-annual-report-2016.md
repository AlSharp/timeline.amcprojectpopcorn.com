LEAWOOD, KANSAS - (Revised March 10, 2017) -- 

AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) (“AMC” or “the Company”), the largest theatrical exhibition company in the U.S., in Europe and in the world, and an industry leader in innovation and operational excellence, today reported results 
for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. 
Highlights for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016 include the following: 
- AMC set fourth quarter records for the three months ended December 31 period for all revenue categories: admissions, food and beverage and other.
- Total revenues increased 18.1% to $926.1 million compared to total revenues of $783.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015.

the transaction to acquire Carmike Cinemas, Inc.
- **Adjusted EBITDA** increased 17.9% to $181.6 million compared to $154.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015. 

## Adjusted EBITDA: 

- does not reflect our capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or 
contractual commitments; 
- does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
- does not reflect the significant interest expenses, or the cash requirements necessary to service 
interest or principal payments, on our debt; 
- excludes income tax payments that represent a reduction in cash available to us; and
- does not reflect any cash requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may 
have to be replaced in the future.

>AMC’s laser-like focus on the priorities that drive considerable growth is what differentiates us, and what has established AMC as the clear and undisputed leader among movie-theatre operators,

### said Adam Aron, AMC Chief Executive Officer and President. 

>Our innovations with powered recliner seats, enhanced food and beverage initiatives and the expansion of premium large format offerings, combined with AMC’s world class marketing efforts, has created industry defining guest experiences and engagement. In concert with a prudent and opportunistic acquisition strategy, 2016 resulted in the successful acquisition of Odeon, Europe’s largest movie exhibitor, and Carmike Cinemas, the nation’s then fourth largest domestic exhibitor, and presented AMC with the opportunity to acquire Nordic Cinema Group, announced in January of 2017. AMC has never been better positioned to leverage our proven strategic initiatives across a growing platform both here in the U.S. and across the globe.

## Recent Acquisition Announcements

Nordic Cinema Group: As previously announced on January 23, 2017, AMC has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Stockholm-based Nordic Cinema Group Holding AB (“Nordic”), the largest theatre exhibitor in seven countries in Scandinavia, and the Nordic and Baltic regions. Nordic operates 68 theatres and has a substantial minority interest (approximately a 50% ownership) in another 50 associated theatres to which Nordic provides a variety of shared services. Nordic's theatres hold the #1 market share in Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Nordic currently is number two in market share in Norway, and with a new theatre currently under construction in Norway and scheduled to open next year, is expected to increase market share in Norway to number one as well. Nordic also has theatres in Denmark. AMC is purchasing Nordic from European private equity firm Bridgepoint and Swedish media group Bonnier Holding in an all-cash transaction valued at SEK 8,250 million ($929 million USD).

On March 3, 2016, we, along with Carmike Cinemas, Inc. ("Carmike"), announced our entry into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which we will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Carmike for $30.00 per share in cash or approximately $757 million. We entered into a debt financing commitment letter in connection with the merger agreement which provides senior secured incremental term loans in an aggregate amount of up to $560 million and a senior subordinated bridge loan in an aggregate amount of up to $300 million to fund the acquisition and to backstop the change of control put option in the existing Carmike indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will be successful.

**The transaction is conditional upon antitrust clearance by the European Commission, which is expected to be completed before June 30, 2017.**

## Our substantial debt could adversely affect our operations and prevent us from satisfying those debt obligations.

We have a significant amount of debt. As of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding approximately **$3,761.0 million of indebtedness ($3,834.4 million face amount)**, which consisted of $1,691.3 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility ($1,721.8 million face amount), $1,823.5 million of our existing subordinated notes ($1,878.4 million face amount), $246.2 million of the Carmike Notes ($230.0 million face amount), a $4.2 million promissory note, $675.4 million of existing capital and financing lease obligations, and $137.4 million available for borrowing under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. **As of December 31, 2016, we also had approximately $6.2 billion of undiscounted rental payments under operating leases (with initial base terms generally between 15 to 20 years)**. 
**We will also increase our debt substantially in connection with the Nordic Acquisition, if completed.** The amount of our indebtedness and lease and other financial obligations could have important consequences to our stockholders.

## Recent Equity Offering

In connection with the acquisitions of Odeon/UCI and Carmike, and the planned acquisition of Nordic, in February 2017 AMC **raised more than $640 million of additional equity through the sale of 20,330,874 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock**, par value $0.01 per share, at $31.50 per share.

The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $618.0 million after deducting underwriting commissions and before deducting estimated offering expenses. AMC used the net proceeds from this offering to repay $350 million principal amount of outstanding bridge loans incurred in connection with its completed acquisition of Carmike Cinemas, Inc. and intends to use the remaining proceeds to finance a portion of the previously announced acquisition of Nordic. If the Nordic acquisition is not consummated, AMC will use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes.
