AMC stock is tanking. And once again, it has to do with dilution the retail investors shares and selling new shares into the hands of hedge funds carrying short positions.

On Thursday, the movie theater chain filed for a stock offering of up to $350 million. Based on the current price, that's about 35-45 million shares, or 350-450 million shares before the conversion and reverse stock split.

AMC said it would use the funds to "bolster liquidity, to repay, refinance, redeem or repurchase its existing indebtedness (including expenses, accrued interest and premium, if any) and for general corporate purposes."

Shares fell as much as 20% on the news, before paring some of their losses.

This is the second time the stock has been offered to the market in the past two months. In September, the company sold 40 million shares. Then the share price fell, after conversion, reverse stock split, new share offer, from $41 to $7. Investors lost 80% after this action by the company's board of directors.

AMC's $0.09 loss per share was narrower than the $0.20 loss that the Street had expected while the company's revenue came in at $1.41 billion, above estimates for $1.26 in revenue.

Aron said on the company's earnings call that AMC wouldn't reveal the material impact from the Beyonce and Taylor Swift movies until the fourth quarter earnings call.

"For what it's worth we did very well," Aron said. "We're going to make a handsome profit from having facilitated what was in stadium concert tour, getting it converted to film, and getting it in theaters quickly."
