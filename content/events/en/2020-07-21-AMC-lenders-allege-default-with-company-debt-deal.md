A group of lenders holding a majority of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.'s $2 billion term loan opposes the company's planned debt overhaul. They allege that AMC violated the terms of its credit agreement by providing inadequate information about the proposed debt swap and agreement with private equity firm Silver Lake. The lenders, including Apollo Global Management Inc., Ares Management Corp., and Eaton Vance Corp., sent a notice of default, stating that AMC's responses to inquiries were **"completely inadequate".** Despite additional information provided by AMC, the group remains unconvinced and operates as if the company is still in default.

The lenders, **representing a majority of the company’s US$2 billion term loan**, sent AMC a notice of default. They said in a July 12 letter seen by Bloomberg that AMC’s response to questions about the permissibility of a **planned debt swap and agreement with private equity firm Silver Lake was “completely inadequate.”**

**AMC has provided additional information since the letter was sent, but the group still doesn’t view the disclosures as sufficient and is operating as if the company is still in default,** according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private transactions.

The letter called Silver Lake a company insider and argued the theatre chain’s **“blatant refusal”** to provide more information means **“there is no reasonable basis”** to conclude the exchange is allowed.

**Silver Lake has a seat on AMC’s board**, but recused itself from discussions related to the debt transaction, one of the people said. Supporters of the existing deal believe the financing is permissible under AMC’s credit documents, the person added.

## Lawyers at Gibson Dunn & Crutcher and bankers at Greenhill & Co. signed the letter on behalf of a group that includes Apollo Global Management Inc., Ares Management Corp. and Eaton Vance Corp., according to the people.

Representatives for AMC, Gibson Dunn and Greenhill didn’t respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Silver Lake declined to comment.

## Swap Deal

AMC had been working to tame its debt load and boost liquidity as the COVID-19 pandemic forced its theatre shut. The company struck a deal with a majority of bondholders earlier this month that would give it fresh cash and more time to repay its debts.

As part of the plans, Silver Lake, which owns a majority of the company’s convertible bonds, **agreed to buy US$100 million of new first-lien notes at around 90% of face value.** The private equity firm is getting advice from Moelis & Co., the people said.

## A representative for Moelis didn’t immediately return messages seeking comment.

AMC’s existing subordinated noteholders would swap their debt for new second-lien secured notes due 2026, and have the option to purchase US$200 million of new 10.5% first-lien notes due the same year. Bondholders have until Friday to turn in their securities at the most favorable terms.

The opposing lenders are working with the company and subordinated bondholders on alternative offers that would hand Silver Lake 1.5-lien debt instead of first-lien notes. **The proposal would hand AMC as much as US$500 million of new liquidity, with US$300 million coming from the lender group.** Earlier talks had centered on first-lien lenders putting in around US$200 million, Bloomberg previously reported.

**The lenders also asked Citigroup Inc. to resign as administrative agent on AMC’s loan,** according to a separate letter seen by Bloomberg. Citi remains on the loan but intends to step down when a new agent is appointed, one of the people said.

## A representative for Citi declined to comment.

Credit Suisse Asset Management and Davidson Kempner Capital Management are also in the opposing lender group, which says the planned transaction **violates AMC’s fiduciary duty, dilutes the value of their holdings and deprives the theatre chain of additional liquidity,** the people said.

The company’s planned deal would hand AMC US$300 million in fresh funds and cut its debt load by at least US$460 million, according to a statement last week.

## Key Risks:

Default Risk: 
The lenders' notice of default raises concerns about AMC's compliance with its credit agreement, posing a risk of default. This could lead to broader financial repercussions, affecting the company's ability to secure financing and manage its debt.

Legal and Fiduciary Risks:
The opposition group, including Silver Lake, alleges that the proposed transaction violates AMC's fiduciary duty, dilutes the value of their holdings, and deprives the company of additional liquidity. These legal and fiduciary risks could result in legal challenges and impact the company's financial and operational standing.

Liquidity Concerns:
The lenders' opposition to the planned transaction, which aims to reduce debt and increase liquidity, introduces uncertainty about AMC's ability to address its liquidity challenges. This could affect the company's financial stability and its ability to weather the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the theater industry.
