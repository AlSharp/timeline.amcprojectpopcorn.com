An unprecedented flood of bets by amateur investors may have cost Wall Street hedge funds billions of dollars on Wednesday, but one private equity firm was sitting pretty. Silver Lake Management exited its equity stake in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., generating around $284 million after converting bonds to equity and selling the shares as the movie theater chain’s stock rallied.

## A $600 million bond investment that buyout firm Silver Lake made in AMC Entertainment Holdings in 2018 

is now in the money thanks a 301% surge in the struggling movie theater chain's shares on Wednesday, fueled by retail investors organizing on social media platforms such as Reddit.

With AMC’s stock surging to nearly $20 per share Wednesday, the firm elected to convert its $600 million bond into AMC stock at a conversion price of $13.51 per share, according to a securities filing Thursday morning. The move will lighten AMC’s debt load by $600 million, but will also see the company issue 44,422,860 Class A shares to Silver Lake, giving it an instant gain of $284 million.

## Silver Lake declined to comment.

AMC's shares had fallen 70% in 2020 to close the year at $2.12 apiece, as many of its movie theaters closed or operated with reduced capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic. But the company became the latest darling of retail traders this week, which organize in social media to bet on heavily shorted stocks such as GameStop Corp.

## In July 2021, Silver Lake agreed to restructure its convertible bonds AMC as part of a debt restructuring deal that allowed it to stave off bankruptcy, and also gave it an additional $100 million in financing.

Silver Lake, which is led by Egon Durban and Greg Mondre, has around $75 billion in assets and committed capital. 

One credit hedge fund manager told the Financial Times that Silver Lake made **“the trade of a lifetime thanks to the basement bandits.”**

## The conversion instantly made Silver Lake the largest shareholder outside of Wanda Group, 

which has control of the company through its Class B stock (Wanda agreed to forfeit 5,666,000 Class B shares under the terms of the Silver Lake deal).

Silver Lake may not be the only firm to take advantage. **Last month, Mudrick Capital Management, which also holds debt in AMC, converted $100 million of AMC debt into common stock. While it isn’t yet clear if the firm sold during the surge, it too would see earnings in the hundreds of millions.**

## On Thursday, AMC Entertainment, led by Adam Aron, opened at $16 per share, but as of writing had fallen below $9.

That’s still up substantially from the beginning of the month, when it was trading at $2. At the same time, the popular casual trading app Robinhood announced that it would temporarily stop users from buying shares in certain companies including AMC and GameStop, only letting them sell.
