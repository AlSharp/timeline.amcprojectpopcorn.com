Movie theater giant AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. won its bid to halt a shareholder’s lawsuit for six months to allow independent investigators to probe the allegations of improper stock trading by its controlling shareholders.

Delaware Court of Chancery Vice Chancellor Joseph R. Slights III, who sided with AMC’s independent investigative committee in granting the stay Oct. 25, gave the investigators until April 6 to look into the claims.

Linda Lao, a shareholder of AMC common stock, sued the company in Delaware in April, alleging that AMC’s controlling shareholders—Wang Jianlin, one of China’s wealthiest citizens, and Dalian Wanda Group Co. Ltd., ...

On April 22, 2019, a putative stockholder class and derivative complaint, captioned Lao v. Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd., et al., C.A. No. 2019-0303-JRS (the “Lao Action”), was filed against certain of the Company’s directors, Wanda, two of Wanda’s affiliates, Silver Lake, and one of Silver Lake’s affiliates in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The Lao Action asserts claims directly, on behalf of a putative class of Company stockholders, and derivatively, on behalf of the Company, for breaches of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty with respect to transactions that the Company entered into with affiliates of Wanda and Silver Lake on September 14, 2018, and the special cash dividend of $1.55 per share of Common Stock that was payable on September 28, 2018 to the Company’s stockholders of record as of September 25, 2018. On July 18, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors formed a Special Litigation Committee to investigate and evaluate the claims and allegations asserted in the Lao Action and make a determination as to how the Company should proceed with respect to the Lao Action. On January 8, 2021, the Special Litigation Committee filed a report with the court recommending that the court dismiss all of the claims asserted in the Lao Action, and moved to dismiss all of the claims in the Lao Action. On June 6, 2022, the parties signed a stipulation of settlement to resolve the Lao Action for $17,375,000 (the “Settlement Amount”). Defendants agreed to the settlement and the payment of the Settlement Amount solely to eliminate the burden, expense, and uncertainty of
further litigation, and continue to expressly deny any liability or wrongdoing with respect to the matters alleged in the Lao Action. On September 28, 2022, the court held a hearing to consider whether to approve the proposed settlement. At the hearing, the court requested a supplemental notice to stockholders prior to approval. A second hearing regarding approval of the settlement was held on November 30, 2022. Following the hearing, also on November 30, 2022, the court issued an order and final judgment approving the settlement and dismissing the action. The order and final judgment included a fee and expense award to Plaintiff’s counsel in the amount of $3,450,000 to be paid out of the 144 Settlement Amount. The remainder of the Settlement Amount was paid to the Company on January 6, 2023. See Note 16—Subsequent Events for further information.
