Apollo, which along with Canyon Capital Advisors and Davidson Kempner Capital Management are holders of AMC’s first-lien debt, are urging the company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and have offered $1 billion in debtor-in-possession financing, according to sources close to the situation.

**The deal would keep its theater doors open in the coming year — and land AMC in the hands of of the investment firms,** the sources said. Apollo — whose embattled chief executive Leon Black is being probed over his ties to dead pedophile Jeffrey Epstein — is leading the campaign to take control of AMC, insiders said.

AMC’s embattled chief executive Adam Aron is resisting Apollo’s overture and looking to buy time. On Friday, **the company instead announced it has reached a deal to borrow $100 million in senior loans from Mudrick Capital Management at a 15-percent interest rate.**

**“Adam Aron is trying to figure out if the vaccine is on its way and will there be enough of a movie business to get past this point,”** according to a source close to the talks.

## In a written statement, AMC on Friday confirmed that 

>certain first-lien creditors and other parties have indicated a willingness to provide financing in a bankruptcy scenario, including debtor-in-possession financing,

without naming Apollo or the other firms.

The theater chain also admitted that the $100 million loan from Mudrick won’t keep the lights on past January, and that it **will need at least another $750 million in cash to stay afloat through next year.**

## Accordingly, the company said it’s looking at other alternatives to Apollo’s proposal, including converting some second-lien debt to equity and issuing new stock to raise cash.

It’s not clear what investor appetites will be for more AMC shares, insiders said — especially after Warner Bros. announced this week that its entire movie slate for 2021 will be released simultaneously in theaters and on its HBO Max home-streaming service. **The risk that other studios including Disney could adopt similar strategies is uncertain,** sources said.
