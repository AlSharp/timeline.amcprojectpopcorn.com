AMC Theatres said Wednesday that it has completed its acquisition of Carmike Cinemas for approximately $1.1 billion, including the assumption of Carmike debt, making it the largest U.S. movie theater chain.

AMC Theatres, majority-owned by the Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group, is now the largest exhibitor in the U.S., Europe and the world, operating 900 venues with more than 10,000 screens globally. That includes 661 theaters with more than 8,200 screens in the U.S. and 244 theaters with 2,200 screens in Europe.

“AMC now has a larger audience and a bigger stage to introduce our industry-leading innovations, including plush power-recliner seats, enhanced food and beverage choices and premium large format screens,” said AMC CEO and president Adam Aron.

He added: “We also have expanded AMC’s footprint across greater geography and more diverse demographics, serving most of the largest cities in the U.S. and Europe, along with hundreds of home towns, where guests can have an amazing AMC experience. In the United States, AMC now will enjoy increased benefit from movies that play better on Main Street and movies that play better in major metros, and, of course, from movies that play well in both.”

The U.S. Department of Justice said Tuesday that it has approved the deal with conditions. AMC must sell theaters in 15 markets in nine states where it competes with Carmike, plus it must divest most of its holdings in in-theater advertising firm National CineMedia.

The company previously acquired European cinema giant Odeon & UCI Cinemas Group.
