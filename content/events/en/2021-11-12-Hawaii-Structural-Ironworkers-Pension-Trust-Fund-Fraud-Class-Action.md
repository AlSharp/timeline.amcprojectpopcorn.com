In a 17-page preliminary approval order, Judge Nathan relayed that the settlement was the product of informed, extensive armâ€™s-length and non-collusive negotiations between the parties in the wake of mediation directed by an experienced mediator. The judge also wrote that the settlement eliminates the risks the parties would have faced in continuing the litigation and did not provide undue preferential treatment to either side or excessive compensation to attorneys.

### The order states

>The Settlement falls within a range of reasonableness that would warrant eventual final approval and is therefore sufficiently fair, reasonable, and adequate to warrant providing notice of the Settlement to the Class and further consideration of the Settlement at the Final Approval Hearing described below.
 
A final approval hearing is scheduled for February 10, 2022 at the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse in Manhattan.
