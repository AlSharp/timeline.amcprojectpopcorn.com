## The Combined Company After Closing the Transaction

AMC is one of the nation’s premier entertainment companies with 5,426 screens and the most productive theatres in the country’s top markets. Carmike, America’s hometown theatre circuit, has 2,954 screens, primarily located in mid-size, non-urban communities. Together AMC and Carmike would have well over 600 theatre locations in 45 states across the country, including the District of Columbia. The transaction is expected to provide significant growth for AMC and will allow it to bring its innovative amenities and best-in-class customer experience to enhance the movie-going experience for more customers in more areas.

## Key Benefits of the Transaction

The transaction is expected to result in free cash flow per share accretion, exclusive of one-time transaction-related charges, in 2017 and beyond, and is expected to produce annual cost synergies of approximately $35 million. Other key benefits of the transaction include:
- Diversifying AMC’s footprint by adding theatres with complementary geographic and guest demographic profiles that strengthen the combined company’s admissions growth potential with limited geographic overlap;
- Expanding AMC’s proven and successful guest experience strategies to millions of new guests in complementary markets;
- Reducing related General and Administrative expenses by combining back-of-the-house functions such as accounting, finance and technology. The result is a more efficient and effective competitor through greater scale, scope and expertise. The combined company will be headquartered in Leawood, Kansas. Adam Aron will serve as Chief Executive Officer and President, and Craig Ramsey will serve as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer;
- The maintenance of AMC’s quarterly dividend;
- The maintenance of AMC’s balance sheet flexibility and attractive leverage profile; and
- AMC’s receiving substantial additional value in NCM LLC, a subsidiary of National CineMedia, Inc. (NASDAQ: NCMI).

We also look forward to welcoming so many talented Carmike employees to the AMC team.”**

   **“Our combination with AMC is a transformative milestone for Carmike and one that provides significant value to Carmike shareholders,”** stated David Passman, Carmike President and Chief Executive Officer. **“By joining with AMC, we are bringing together two highly complementary theatre footprints and a shared commitment to service and innovation, positioning the combined company to deliver an even more compelling movie-going experience in many more locations across the country.

We look forward to working together with the AMC team to complete the transaction and to ensure a seamless transition.”**
